# Overview
I am tasked with analyzing employee turnover at Salifort Motors using Python for model building and data analysis as a part of Advanced Google Data Analysis capstone project. The company is experiencing high turnover rates, and leadership wants to understand the key drivers behind employee departures to improve retention and reduce costs.
I will work with survey data and build predictive models to determine whether an employee is likely to leave the company. Logistic regression or machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost will be built after this prject. My goal is to evaluate different models and provide insights into factors influencing turnover.
In addition to developing a strong predictive model, I will need to communicate findings effectively by preparing an executive summary that presents key takeaways and recommendations to stakeholders.
